/**
  Bankswitching method used by Activison's Robot Tank and Decathlon.

  Kevin Horton describes FE as follows:

    Used only on two carts (Robot Tank and Decathlon).  These 
    carts are very weird.  It does not use accesses to the stack 
    like was previously thought.  Instead, if you watch the called 
    addresses very carefully, you can see that they are either Dxxx 
    or Fxxx.  This determines the bank to use.  Just monitor A13 of 
    the processor and use it to determine your bank! :-)  Of course 
    the 6507 in the 2600 does not have an A13, so the cart must have 
    an extra bit in the ROM matrix to tell when to switch banks.  
    There is *no* way to determine which bank you want to be in from
    monitoring the bus.
